					           Program Description :    Let m and n be 32-bit unsigned integers.Use bitwise operations to assig n to m the following functions of n: 1) 1, if n is odd, 0 if n is even. 2) 1, if n is divisible by 4, 0 otherwise. 3) 2n(Assume that n<= 31). 4) n rotated by k positions to the left for some integer k>= 0. 5) n rotated by k positions to the right for some integer k>= 0.*/
